- NUMBER 1 - Spawn a ball in mouse position.

## Combos

If the player manages to light up all the blue circles, they will gain 40 extra points. Activating all the bouncers will also give 50 points.

## Differences 

- Font on score numbers is different than the original.

- The big bouncer in the middle of the table has been repositioned so the ball wouldn't get stuck between the bouncer and the wall near it.

- There are no button animations, on the menus only the play buttons are functional.

- Background music and audio FX are different than the original game.

- The game is faster paced.
